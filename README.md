ABOUT ME
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to My Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am currently a double major student at UEH, having recently graduated with a degree in Business Administration and now in my final year of Marketing. Throughout my studies in Marketing, I discovered a strong passion for data analysis, which led me to explore this field further by enrolling in various online courses on data analytics.

I now have a solid foundation in data analysis, particularly in problem-solving—breaking down complex issues, identifying key components, and developing structured solutions. I have also gained experience in creating dashboards using Excel. Additionally, I have completed courses in SQL, from basic to advanced levels, and have worked on multiple projects that strengthened my ability to conduct data analysis effectively using SQL. However, I recognize that Excel and SQL alone may not be the most optimal tools, so I plan to complete courses in Python and Power BI in the coming months to further enhance my analytical capabilities.

During my university years, I was involved in several research projects, which helped me develop strong statistical and probability analysis skills. In my free time, I enjoy reading to expand my knowledge and refine my soft skills. I also regularly practice data analysis by working on real-world case studies I find online. Solving analytical problems excites me, and I often see it as both a challenge and a form of entertainment.

I am confident that my analytical skills and experience make me a strong candidate for a data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio informative and engaging, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Thank you for your time! I look forward to hearing from you soon.
