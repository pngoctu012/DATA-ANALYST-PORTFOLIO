DATA ANALYSTICS WITH SQL
My SQL project space showcases a collection of hands-on projects where I have applied SQL to solve real-world data problems. From data cleaning and transformation to advanced querying and performance optimization, each project reflects my ability to extract valuable insights from large datasets. I have worked on various topics, such as customer behavior analysis, sales performance tracking, and business intelligence reporting. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in writing efficient queries, using joins and subqueries, and implementing analytical functions to support data-driven decision-making.
