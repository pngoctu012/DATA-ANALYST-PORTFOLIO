DATA ANALYSTICS WITH SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My SQL project space is a collection of hands-on projects where I have applied SQL to tackle real-world data challenges, showcasing my ability to clean, transform, and analyze large datasets effectively. These projects cover a range of business scenarios, including customer behavior analysis, sales performance tracking, and business intelligence reporting. Through these experiences, I have developed strong skills in writing efficient queries, leveraging joins and subqueries, and utilizing window functions to generate meaningful insights. One of my notable projects involved analyzing an e-commerce platformâ€™s customer purchase history to identify trends in buying behavior, order frequency, and product performance. I optimized queries to handle large volumes of data efficiently and provided key business recommendations based on my findings. Additionally, I have worked on performance tuning techniques to ensure faster query execution and better database management. Each project in this space reflects my continuous learning and passion for data analysis, demonstrating my ability to extract actionable insights that support business decision-making.
