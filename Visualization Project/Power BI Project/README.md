# Introduction
This dataset comprises dairy-based products collected as part of my Data Analyst course. It covers the period from 2019 to 2022 and specifically focuses on selected dairy brands operating across various states and union territories of India.

Based on this dataset, we can perform a comprehensive analysis of the business performance of dairy farms, including evaluating the productivity of individual farms, the performance of different dairy products, and the success of associated brands. Additionally, the data allows for a thorough inventory analysis, including stock levels, sales trends, stock turnover, and restocking needs. This analysis will provide insights into operational efficiency, product demand, and supply chain management across various regions and distribution channels.
